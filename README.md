# PyBer_Analysis

## Summary

For this project ridesharing data collected from PyBer was used to analyze the overall ridership in three city category types; urban, suburban, and rural. Using tools such as Pythons SciPy and Numpy , Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib the data was analyzed, and visualizations were made of rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Along with how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
  
## Results

### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

Reviewing the dataframe below demonstrates a couple things. One is that although there is a 42% difference in the average fare per ride between the rural and urban city types, there is a 334% difference in the average fare per driver. Looking closer at the information related to driver counts and total rides is where it appears the lower average fare per driver comes from for the urban driver. In the rural city type there is an average of 1.6 rides per driver vs the urban city type who only average .67 rides per driver.

### Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

This graph represents the total fares week by week for the different city types. The three groups run farily consistent with one another over the four months in question. As seen below the urban city type consistently has the higher total fares month over month. While the rural city type has the lowest total fares.

## Summary

Through reviewing all of the data made available from PyBer I was able to determine the three different city types and how they have performed ridership and fare wise. While the urban city type has the highest ridership it falls in the low end when looking at average fare per ride and average fare per driver. I believe with some adjustments as outlined below PyBer would be able to increase ridership and overall driver satisfaction. 

1. Look into decreasing the number of drivers by 1/3 in the urban areas to allow for each driver to get over an average of one fare similar to the other two city types. 
2. Average rural fares per ride are the highest of the three city types. Ridership however is the lowest in this category. Based on this information it would be important to increase ridership in the rural city type by advertising services available. 
3. In mid Feb. all three city categories saw increased total fares. Determine what led to this increase and attempt to emulate over other periods of time.
