# PyBer_Analysis

## Summary

For this project ridesharing data collected from PyBer was used to analyze the overall ridership in three city category types; urban, suburban, and rural. Using tools such as Pythons SciPy and Numpy , Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib the data was analyzed, and visualizations were made of rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Along with how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
  
## Results

### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

Reviewing the dataframe below demonstrates a couple things. One is that although there is a 42% difference in the average fare per ride between the rural and urban city types, there is a 334% difference in the average fare per driver. Looking closer at the information related to driver counts and total rides is where it appears the lower average fare per driver comes from for the urban driver. In the rural city type there is an average of 1.6 rides per driver vs the urban city type who only average .67 rides per driver.
