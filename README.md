##Summary

For this project ridesharing data collected from PyBer was used to analyze the overall ridership in three city category types; urban, suburban, and rural. Using tools such as Pythons SciPy and Numpy , Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib the data was analyzed, and visualizations were made of rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
